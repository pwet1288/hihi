            For me, dreams were always just dreams. Nothing to look forward to, nothing too serious. <br>
            It was never a thing I could believe in, maybe it was just a funny story to tell someone <br>
            but it's never believable. Though, there was a time that I hoped this one dream came true. <br>
            A girl in my dreams appeared, she was funny, weird, beautiful in her own way. I fell for her, <br>
            my heart yearned for her, I wanted to be with her. But, I still didn't believe that it was true, <br>
            that it meant anything to me. But it gave me feeling of uncertainty. <br>
     
        </p>

        <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
            Then, this mystery girl would soon unravel. Growing up, it became clearer, I came to realize that <br>
            my dream actually came true. For years on end I didn't expect that I would ever know who she is, <br>
            or even know what she looks like, I thought it would stay as a dream. Until she came. Then, <br>
            something changed. Or rather someone came into my life and changed everything. <br>

        <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
            <b style="color: cadetblue;"><i>Phoebe.</i></b> The girl I dreamt about. She's kind, beautiful inside and out, funny, and the person <br>
            I connect with on the highest level. Talking to her, I already felt familiar, close. <br>
            It's like I had known her all my life <br>

        </p>

        
        <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
            <b style="color: cadetblue;"><i>Phoebe</i></b> illuminated the places I never realized were dark, fixed the parts of me that I never knew was broken. <br>
            She made me grow as a person, supported me, stood beside me whatever happened. I always believed I was fine with myself, <br>
            until she came, and showed me how powerful I can be with her.

        </p>

        <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
           Being with her, it made me scared, nervous and frightened of losing someone. <br>
           Something I thought I long accepted. Caring for someone,  it makes this feeling stronger. <br>
           It makes their absence unimaginable. <br>

        </p>

         <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
           This isn't only a love story, or how much I love someone. It's a realization that dreams do can come true. <br>
           And when it does, it comes with lessons, challenges, and growth you never saw coming.<br>
            

        </p>

        <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
            I wrote this not just an expression of my love, but to show appreciation for everything <b style="color: cadetblue;"><i>Phoebe</i></b> has done for me, <br>
            for our relationship.No words, or actions can ever make up to show how much I'm grateful, but I'll say this: <br>
        

        </p>

         <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">
           <b style="color: cadetblue;"><i>Phoebe</i></b>, I can never express how thankful I am for you, but thank you for making my dream come true. <br>
            For being with me. For making me believe that love is more than just a simple words. <br>
            And, I love you. More than I ever thought I could love anyone. <br>
         </p>
